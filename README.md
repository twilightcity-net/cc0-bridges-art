# cc0-bridges-art

This repository includes digital art designed to be a set of spatial maps for community collaboration, bridge building, and idea sharing.  Our intention is to help communities come together, inspire vision, and create the possibility of getting somewhere new.  The digital art is contributed by Twilight City, Inc as a CC0 Public Domain Dedication to support the first Bridges Summit virtual unconference events, to inspire bridge building and community building far and wide, and to support us humans in coming together to create the bright future that's already possible.

## Spatial Maps for Bridges

The spatial map digital art includes:

1) Four *Table Room* spatial maps with 8 virtual tables designed for community breakout discussions, each table has infinite gathering space, and the tables are positioned on the map to allow for 8 separate conversations.  The Table Room spatial maps come in four different colors: Purple, Blue, Green, and Rose.

2) Three *Idea Garden* spatial maps designed for community idea sharing, to support the community in sharing insights and synthesizing ideas from the discussions.  Community members can place their ideas in the Idea Garden, then walk around on a foot print pathway to visit the different ideas, discuss with other community members, and get inspired. The Idea Garden spatial maps come in three different variations of garden crops of: Carrots, Pumpkins, and Strawberries.
